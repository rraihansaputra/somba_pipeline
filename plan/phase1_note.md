# Phase 1 - Simplified Note

## Status: InferencePipeline Already Validated ✅

The Roboflow InferencePipeline is already working excellently. Phase 1 is simply:

1. **Confirm go2rtc integration works** with the test video
2. **Verify InferencePipeline can connect** to go2rtc RTSP stream
3. **Basic smoke test** - no performance testing needed

## Quick Validation Script

```python
# validate_setup.py
from inference import InferencePipeline
import time

# Test with go2rtc stream
pipeline = InferencePipeline.init(
    model_id="coco/11",
    video_reference="rtsp://localhost:8554/test_video",
    on_prediction=lambda p, f: print(f"Frame {f.frame_id}: {len(p.get('predictions', []))} detections"),
    max_fps=5
)

pipeline.start()
time.sleep(10)  # Run for 10 seconds
pipeline.terminate()
print("✅ InferencePipeline works with go2rtc")
```

## Next Step: Phase 2
Proceed directly to Phase 2 to build the production Worker with full technical specification compliance.
